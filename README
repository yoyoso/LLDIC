README file for LLDIC
(Low-power Low-cost Do-it-yourself Intelligent Controller)


*Goal

LLDIC is a project for fun; it is the kind of fun for one who enjoys learning by doing.

Here we try to create a "Controller". It has sensors and will do something to its 
environment. Hopefully it will enhance the reach of its "Intelligent" users.

We target "Low-cost" because we want to have the most fun for the buck. 
So less for the same result is more.

LLDIC is going to run 24/7 in many situations. "Low-power" is important. We like green.


*Approach

To start, we are going to use the Dreamplug from Globalscale with the USB-DUX from 
linux-usb-daq.co.uk.

Software will all be from the web or DIY. Open source, open standard. Free.

We will get comedi (with USB-DUX driver) and EPICS (aps.anl.gov/epics) running on 
the Dreamplug, USB-DUX combination. Since Ubuntu for armel is running on the Dreamplug,
these first steps will already open up many possibilities. 

The total startup cost is far less than a thousand US dollars. "Low-cost" now is
$700 if we count the cables and USB-SSD. The display connected to it during development
need not be part of the LLDIC in operations. A part-time monitor through the gigabit-
ethernet port may be sufficient.  

The USB-DUX DAQ multifunction board and the USB-SSD need no additional power 
source other than the Dreamplug's USB-port. So "Low-power" for this setup is about 
five watts.

We start with a system capable of full Linux (Debian or Ubuntu) development so that
LLDIC's "Intelligence" will grow with the advances in robotics and AGI.

The hardware and software of LLDIC shall evolve as better (lower power, lower cost,
less work for DIYers, more general intelligence, more control domains and resolution)
open-technologies become available.
